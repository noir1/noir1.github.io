<blockquote>
<div align="right"><font size="2"> 花の色は うつりにけりな いたづらに<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;わが身世にふる ながめせしまに </font></div>

<div align="right"><font size="2">“Color of flower<br>faded in the vain’nd<br>So is my body<br>Wet while taking a sight”<br>(translated by writer)</font></div>

</blockquote>
<p>&#160;She is Ono no Komachi, said to be a concubine of Emperor Ninmyō and noted for her invincible beauty and Waka (Japanese verse) about passionate love with finesse, saturnity and lusciousness, which are collected in “Man Yō Shū”, the most antique collectanea, editted from late 700AD to late 800AD.</p>
<p>&#160;Kamachi was gifted with, if not best, a considerable beauty. Begotten by the govenor of a northeast county Dewa-no-Kuni, she moved to Hēankyō 13 years old. Aromatized with the culture and etiquette of Kyō (the capital), Komachi went beyond the moat to be a Kōi (a concubine level of emperor) and received, by no doubt, adoration from Emperor.</p>
<p>&#160;But, she quitted, silently, to her fatherland, at the year of her 36 with an excuse of homesick. As she compared with the color of flower, the lady knew clearly of her ephemeral youth. After then romantic stories arrived with no cease. A lengend goes that a young man attracted by Komachi went after her to Dewa-no-kuni and wrote a love letter to confess. Komachi replied if he could drop at her gate for continuous 100 days, she would agree for marriage. The man took it, and 99 days passed until the last day. It was a snowy night and the young lover was buried in the snow and frozen to death. Komachi sighed days and nights after hearing of it. In a moon night, she rowed a boat and buried the young man’s relics alone. From then on, Komachi lived away and in her rest time she carved sculpture of herself and only incense with her till her 92.</p>
<p>&#160;It’s a lady who admires transient beauty. It’s a lady who is indulged in aesthetism. It’s a lady who shares  longevity. It’s a lady who endures the many instant beauty and death in her long life span. So is Komachi. So is this Nation.</p>
<p>&#160;She says Ichi-go-Ichi-e (One time one life)…</p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="TO_BE">TO BE</h1><p>&#160;Certainly,it’s not honored of me to say kids are too evil to be lovely. But anyway I may say kids are of the most evil in the lovely and of the most lovely in the evil.</p>
<p>&#160;Generally,babies in craddle or even older enough to wag are usually decorated as accessories in their parents’ fashion, such as colored permed curling hair, kids costume of brand (Burbexxy, Toxxy Hilfiger, Poxo Xalph Lauren, GxP etc.). Anytime they keep a amazing silent beyond the children in other countries of the same age and that always draws my interest and admiration for the Japanese parents in how to train baby to follow the etiquette strictly. Meanwhile yet the kids wear their parents’ faces, definitely adults’ faces. They are miniature of their parents.</p>
<p>&#160;Grown a little, young ladies and gentlemen are to face their school life. These young elements change a lot in this period and most of them forget the docility and are ready for breaking any rule on purpose. The unique humor and  “mania” habits that were seeded in their previous age blossom. Boys acting as the Genoujin(showfolk) laugh aloud and girls adoring lovely stuffs like Hellokitty and ACG(Animated Computer Graphic) show a great vital force.</p>
<p>&#160;I guess the Japanese kids are enlightend as to vogue at a very young age much more earlier than foreign countris, judging from their first touch of the “BRAND” eversince their craddle years. The chics keep the custom of making-up before leaving their “Harem”. They wear the most prestigious uniforms worldwide and make trick to let the skirt seems even shorter. They brush their long colored hair freely and are so calmed still in a moving train as to mascara and put on lipstick and at this time they are actually girls rather than ladies apparently. Boys conform the fashion in a femmish way which can’t buy my any attention but distaste anyhow.</p>
<p>&#160;It’s common that a family hold more than 2 children but every single kid are that independant. They conform the public manner superfacially but never lose the strong feeling of ego. They are to grow up to be parents and this is Samsara. They are unique and not easier than the adult to access to their true voice. Anyway, they are young Japanese.</p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="COVERT">COVERT</h1><p>&#160;Bride in Japan is dressed in totally white which was once assumed to be twelve pieces (in Japanese, Jūni-no-hitoe 十二の単) that hide the new wife’s body from all’s sight, putting up exaggeratively white make-up to which small scarlet lips are compared. White stands for candor, loyalty and chasteness, while red presents youth, vitality and fertility. The rite is always traditionally held in a shrine(in Japanese,Jin-ja) and led by the priest in Jin-ja(in Japanese, Gūji).Mysterically, yet obviously this woman is ready for keeping to some extent from the public and from then on she leaves the family that gave her birth for the one of her husband in a very initial way of changing her surname to his.</p>
<p>&#160;The daytime of Sendai in weekdays is embedded with wives away from working, and it is almost like silver thread running across the japanese brocade(in Japanese, Nishiki). Most new wives perhaps stick still to the job in office, while a few of them leave the work place for kitchen. Doing house work and attending as community volunteer are nearly the inside and outside field of them till they have a baby and another and very probably a next.</p>
<p> Carrying a baby in a baby sacbag in front of breast and followed by a little child around, new and amateur mothers drop at supermarket for new promotion and bargain from possibly the way of paying for the bills or making children’s health examination or having consult about insurance in ward office and so on. So do the wives at the age of mother-in-law. The background music is piano and vivace played. It’s alomost the same in every supermarket. So do the wives move in it. Every face of make-up, neatly set hair and fixed thin mouth speaks artificially friendlily softly and no mean for offending.</p>
<p>&#160;Cafe is a good place for wives to have a talk when they take a breakup from a shopping mall in the afternoon, for they have to do charge of preparing garbs of their partners. Paper bags piled around feet are branded with different logo which is familiar to most Japanese. Smiling ma’mes are talking lightly and nodding timely to agree under the lounge music in the sunshine through the comparted window decorated by passers-by on the lane outside. </p>
<p>&#160;Actually, all of this scenery fades not so late. The mama goes back home to prepare for the supper, and drives the car to the JR (Japanese railway) station to pick up her boys and girls after school, maybe even later again in the night for her husband. And it is almost the all of the homemaker wives’ stereotyped life. What kind of fun can they make from it? I do not quite clearly understand. I supposed that I would talk something about the love affair (in Japanese, furin) or Wives’ Club (in Japanese, hitoduma-club kind of a organization held for making chance for marital infidelity…), but I finally gave up this idea. I guess I will mention in an undetermined future…</p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="INTRO_–_TURN-UPS">INTRO – TURN-UPS</h1><p>&#160; An evening in Sendai is a little bit chilly but cozy. Bistro and bar have just been ready for all kinds of tired souls.It isn’t hard to conceal in mob of smelly sweat wafting across Haut Parfum. The faces wearing thin silvery hair walking neck by neck and carrying file bags are absorbingly talking about anecdotes around and bound for the next izakaya (Sake bar). Mademoiselles who loose their bunched long hair, maybe pinching a slim cigarette burning dimly, are fiddling mobile phone in a cornor of cafe and at the same while I guess they never make sense of the background music from Astor Piazzolla absolutely. Young couples are from the high school. Uniform girl with thick make-up in her young lovers arm looking at the dool which is seized in the UFO Catcher game lift her eyes to her hero’s face. Apparently, he is too yound to be a true hero and trimmed eyebrow, colored curled hair and face with speckle can only add to his young extra passion. The pair of backs laso disappear in the crowd under flashing neon.</p>
<p>&#160; It’s some how return to life now in Sendai. The night life of Sendai-ers, even of Japanese, has just sprung out. Darkness brightened up by man-made electric light make men feel safe. They mingle themselves in the crowd without smile or artificial concern and even losing temporarially the sense of feeling. But humanbeing do de facto disgust of known such as unseen in the darkness. Night calms down and save back the nervous hearts from offices, schools and all sorts of cases that human have to pretend to be kind and hide their ho-ne (Japanses, true voice).Yet night whereas can’t help when they can’t see in darness. So the instinct of fearing dark is well-known that night is just an AGNUS for UNSEEN in night itself.</p>
<p>&#160; One friend of mine once told me he liked the black and night. He is a simple one with complicated structure in brain when he soaks in the machinery world and untouchable digital world. A materialistic and canophilic guy whose dream is to live in a lodge in north Europe, accompanied by 3 husky dogs and several sets of high-speed computers and a wife(?) perhaps. His partner told me he liked to see movie all kinds of, but he seldom knew the romance in love and tortured inside for his hurting a girls heart. His partner, my cherished friend, told me some time ago he was an big boy not grown-up yet. I said he was a magic pot in which contrary potions were mixed together. And I guess that’s why he loves darkness and night even fearing of unknown and unseen.</p>
<p>&#160; The night relaxation belongs to the one hide in daytime. Yes,obviously, SOME ONES hide themselves in night. They show up in daytime and whenever and wherever their night active partners are not. That is the confidential Japanese wife…</p>
