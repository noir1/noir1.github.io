#COVERT

&#160;Bride in Japan is dressed in totally white which was once assumed to be twelve pieces (in Japanese, Jūni-no-hitoe 十二の単) that hide the new wife’s body from all’s sight, putting up exaggeratively white make-up to which small scarlet lips are compared. White stands for candor, loyalty and chasteness, while red presents youth, vitality and fertility. The rite is always traditionally held in a shrine(in Japanese,Jin-ja) and led by the priest in Jin-ja(in Japanese, Gūji).Mysterically, yet obviously this woman is ready for keeping to some extent from the public and from then on she leaves the family that gave her birth for the one of her husband in a very initial way of changing her surname to his.
 
&#160;The daytime of Sendai in weekdays is embedded with wives away from working, and it is almost like silver thread running across the japanese brocade(in Japanese, Nishiki). Most new wives perhaps stick still to the job in office, while a few of them leave the work place for kitchen. Doing house work and attending as community volunteer are nearly the inside and outside field of them till they have a baby and another and very probably a next.
 
 Carrying a baby in a baby sacbag in front of breast and followed by a little child around, new and amateur mothers drop at supermarket for new promotion and bargain from possibly the way of paying for the bills or making children’s health examination or having consult about insurance in ward office and so on. So do the wives at the age of mother-in-law. The background music is piano and vivace played. It’s alomost the same in every supermarket. So do the wives move in it. Every face of make-up, neatly set hair and fixed thin mouth speaks artificially friendlily softly and no mean for offending.
 
&#160;Cafe is a good place for wives to have a talk when they take a breakup from a shopping mall in the afternoon, for they have to do charge of preparing garbs of their partners. Paper bags piled around feet are branded with different logo which is familiar to most Japanese. Smiling ma’mes are talking lightly and nodding timely to agree under the lounge music in the sunshine through the comparted window decorated by passers-by on the lane outside. 
 
&#160;Actually, all of this scenery fades not so late. The mama goes back home to prepare for the supper, and drives the car to the JR (Japanese railway) station to pick up her boys and girls after school, maybe even later again in the night for her husband. And it is almost the all of the homemaker wives’ stereotyped life. What kind of fun can they make from it? I do not quite clearly understand. I supposed that I would talk something about the love affair (in Japanese, furin) or Wives’ Club (in Japanese, hitoduma-club kind of a organization held for making chance for marital infidelity…), but I finally gave up this idea. I guess I will mention in an undetermined future…
