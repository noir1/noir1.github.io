&#160;Dimming in the tedious drizzle which had been couching in Hēankyō (now called Kyōto) for days, she murmured in an elegant but sad tone about her graceful yet short youth compared with the color of flowers waving in the rain.


<blockquote class="blockquote-center">花の色は うつりにけりな いたづらに
わが身世にふる ながめせしまに
“Color of flower
faded in the vain’nd 
So is my body
Wet while taking a sight” 
(translated by writer)</blockquote>

&#160;She is Ono no Komachi, said to be a concubine of Emperor Ninmyō and noted for her invincible beauty and Waka (Japanese verse) about passionate love with finesse, saturnity and lusciousness, which are collected in "Man Yō Shū", the most antique collectanea, editted from late 700AD to late 800AD.

&#160;Kamachi was gifted with, if not best, a considerable beauty. Begotten by the govenor of a northeast county Dewa-no-Kuni, she moved to Hēankyō 13 years old. Aromatized with the culture and etiquette of Kyō (the capital), Komachi went beyond the moat to be a Kōi (a concubine level of emperor) and received, by no doubt, adoration from Emperor.

&#160;But, she quitted, silently, to her fatherland, at the year of her 36 with an excuse of homesick. As she compared with the color of flower, the lady knew clearly of her ephemeral youth. After then romantic stories arrived with no cease. A lengend goes that a young man attracted by Komachi went after her to Dewa-no-kuni and wrote a love letter to confess. Komachi replied if he could drop at her gate for continuous 100 days, she would agree for marriage. The man took it, and 99 days passed until the last day. It was a snowy night and the young lover was buried in the snow and frozen to death. Komachi sighed days and nights after hearing of it. In a moon night, she rowed a boat and buried the young man’s relics alone. From then on, Komachi lived away and in her rest time she carved sculpture of herself and only incense with her till her 92.

&#160;It’s a lady who admires transient beauty. It’s a lady who is indulged in aesthetism. It’s a lady who shares  longevity. It’s a lady who endures the many instant beauty and death in her long life span. So is Komachi. So is this Nation.

&#160;She says Ichi-go-Ichi-e (One time one life)…
