# INTRO – TURN-UPS

&#160; An evening in Sendai is a little bit chilly but cozy. Bistro and bar have just been ready for all kinds of tired souls.It isn’t hard to conceal in mob of smelly sweat wafting across Haut Parfum. The faces wearing thin silvery hair walking neck by neck and carrying file bags are absorbingly talking about anecdotes around and bound for the next izakaya (Sake bar). Mademoiselles who loose their bunched long hair, maybe pinching a slim cigarette burning dimly, are fiddling mobile phone in a cornor of cafe and at the same while I guess they never make sense of the background music from Astor Piazzolla absolutely. Young couples are from the high school. Uniform girl with thick make-up in her young lovers arm looking at the dool which is seized in the UFO Catcher game lift her eyes to her hero’s face. Apparently, he is too yound to be a true hero and trimmed eyebrow, colored curled hair and face with speckle can only add to his young extra passion. The pair of backs laso disappear in the crowd under flashing neon.

&#160; It’s some how return to life now in Sendai. The night life of Sendai-ers, even of Japanese, has just sprung out. Darkness brightened up by man-made electric light make men feel safe. They mingle themselves in the crowd without smile or artificial concern and even losing temporarially the sense of feeling. But humanbeing do de facto disgust of known such as unseen in the darkness. Night calms down and save back the nervous hearts from offices, schools and all sorts of cases that human have to pretend to be kind and hide their ho-ne (Japanses, true voice).Yet night whereas can’t help when they can’t see in darness. So the instinct of fearing dark is well-known that night is just an AGNUS for UNSEEN in night itself.

&#160; One friend of mine once told me he liked the black and night. He is a simple one with complicated structure in brain when he soaks in the machinery world and untouchable digital world. A materialistic and canophilic guy whose dream is to live in a lodge in north Europe, accompanied by 3 husky dogs and several sets of high-speed computers and a wife(?) perhaps. His partner told me he liked to see movie all kinds of, but he seldom knew the romance in love and tortured inside for his hurting a girls heart. His partner, my cherished friend, told me some time ago he was an big boy not grown-up yet. I said he was a magic pot in which contrary potions were mixed together. And I guess that’s why he loves darkness and night even fearing of unknown and unseen.

&#160; The night relaxation belongs to the one hide in daytime. Yes,obviously, SOME ONES hide themselves in night. They show up in daytime and whenever and wherever their night active partners are not. That is the confidential Japanese wife…
