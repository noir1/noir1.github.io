# TO BE 

&#160;Certainly,it’s not honored of me to say kids are too evil to be lovely. But anyway I may say kids are of the most evil in the lovely and of the most lovely in the evil.

&#160;Generally,babies in craddle or even older enough to wag are usually decorated as accessories in their parents’ fashion, such as colored permed curling hair, kids costume of brand (Burbexxy, Toxxy Hilfiger, Poxo Xalph Lauren, GxP etc.). Anytime they keep a amazing silent beyond the children in other countries of the same age and that always draws my interest and admiration for the Japanese parents in how to train baby to follow the etiquette strictly. Meanwhile yet the kids wear their parents’ faces, definitely adults’ faces. They are miniature of their parents.

&#160;Grown a little, young ladies and gentlemen are to face their school life. These young elements change a lot in this period and most of them forget the docility and are ready for breaking any rule on purpose. The unique humor and  "mania" habits that were seeded in their previous age blossom. Boys acting as the Genoujin(showfolk) laugh aloud and girls adoring lovely stuffs like Hellokitty and ACG(Animated Computer Graphic) show a great vital force.

&#160;I guess the Japanese kids are enlightend as to vogue at a very young age much more earlier than foreign countris, judging from their first touch of the "BRAND" eversince their craddle years. The chics keep the custom of making-up before leaving their "Harem". They wear the most prestigious uniforms worldwide and make trick to let the skirt seems even shorter. They brush their long colored hair freely and are so calmed still in a moving train as to mascara and put on lipstick and at this time they are actually girls rather than ladies apparently. Boys conform the fashion in a femmish way which can’t buy my any attention but distaste anyhow.

&#160;It’s common that a family hold more than 2 children but every single kid are that independant. They conform the public manner superfacially but never lose the strong feeling of ego. They are to grow up to be parents and this is Samsara. They are unique and not easier than the adult to access to their true voice. Anyway, they are young Japanese.
