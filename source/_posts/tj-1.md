##Day 1
### By train

 Although planned to meet at Peking South Station (SouS) before 9a.m. with Forest and Larry, I still insisted in hurrying David up early in the morning. I had almost packed up, while Dave was still under shower. I went to TJ two days ago for business, and thus had a rough idea of the tube route, where was a transition and which was the shortcut. I chose a tote bag for casual, and suggested Dav my Yoshida Porter shoulder bag for holding.
 SouS was quite lately built, connected with tube. It was actually accommodative yet still a little crammed for tens of thousands of moving travellers. Dav and I were ordering coffees, when texted by Larry. Everything went promptly and smoothly.
 High-Speed Rail (aka. HSR) kept a speed around 300km/h, which did substantially shorten the travel between Peking and TJ. I took out a collection of Haruki Murakami's short fictions and read couples of pages, but failed by a doze. When I open my eyes, we were almost arriving at TJ station.
 
### Lodging

 Forest made reservation at Ritz-Carlton with a good bargain. Ritz-Carlton TJ was located close to Haihe River.

 The interior decoration of the hotel was hardly called refined, personally. Walls were papered in China blue with portraits, which reminded me of a washbowl in a common faked-antique Chinese food restaurant. Shelves were dotted with **faked-books**, some cardboards indeed, and they were golden printed like "My University", "The Count of Monte Cristo"into the spines of books.

 But, frankly, the bedding was excellent, soft yet supportive. It was truly a relax. Curtains opened when door was unlocked. Ambient light was soft and cozy. Bathtub, shower room and the toilet were separate in space. Thus there would be no concerns for 2 persons at a time.

### Astor

 Astor Hotel, established from 1863, was still run in business and also opened to public as a museum. It was no bother to move from Ritz to Astor for just a park lane. The old-fashioned wooden revolving door allowed only one man once. The first elevator in China, glass dome and corridors with mirror at the end across were definitely worth a look.

### Lunch

 We had lunch at Tianjin No.1 Restaurant. Forest, a northwestern toughie, ordered a table of carbohydrates. TJ was famous for fresh seafood, and daily dishes were likely seasoned with small shrimp rather than MSG. Generally it was heavily flavoured and if you preferred to a fishy taste please tried some TJ food out.

### Talk show/Repartee 

 It was absolutely worthy of my ground transportations and 2 day stay at TJ! Funny! Burst into laughter!

### Porcelain House

 I would leave no comment here. I, WTF, was scared at the entrance of the house. I bet it was haunted at night! Ewwwwwwwwwww.........
